# Zomato-Python-EDA
I performed an in-depth analysis of the Zomato dataset by integrating multiple tables using grouping and advanced functions. To uncover insights, I applied visualization techniques such as pie charts and bar charts, highlighting key trends in customer behavior, order distribution, and restaurant performance.
