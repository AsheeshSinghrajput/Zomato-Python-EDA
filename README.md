# Zomato-Python-EDA
I performed an in-depth analysis of the Zomato dataset by integrating multiple tables using grouping and advanced functions. To uncover insights, I applied visualization techniques such as pie charts and bar charts, highlighting key trends in customer behavior, order distribution, and restaurant performance.

## Dataset used
-<a href="https://github.com/AsheeshSinghrajput/Zomato-Python-EDA/blob/main/zomato.csv">Dataset</a>

## Python code

## Questins (KPI)
- Which counties have the maximum orders?
- Which category is the maximum times rating?
- Top 3 countries that gave maximum times zero ratings.
- Which city is the most market captured ?
- Which countries have the online delivery options?
- Top 5 cuisines ?

## Process
- I downloaded the dataset and varifying for any missing values.
- There are two dataset one is data and second one is about country name we merged then to do EDA.
- According to Questions we write the codes.
